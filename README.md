# Microsoft Flight Simulator GPS

MSFSGPS is a small program for MSFS that fetches data using SimConnect and broadcasts it for Foreflight or other apps using their API (https://www.foreflight.com/support/network-gps/) like iFlightPlanner.

Just start the program and start MSFS and it'll start broadcasting on your current network. Any iPads running Foreflight will pick it up if they're on the same network.
